# Predicting of anaphylaxis in big data EMR by exploring machine learningapproaches.

## Abstract

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs suddenly after contact with an allergen.Epidemiological studies about anaphylaxis are very important in planning and evaluating new strategies thatprevent this reaction, but also in providing a guide to the treatment of patients who have just suffered ananaphylactic reaction. Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are one of the most effective and richest sources for theepidemiology of anaphylaxis, because they provide a low-cost way of accessing rich longitudinal data on largepopulations. However, a negative aspect is that researchers have to manually review a huge amount of in-formation, which is a very costly and highly time consuming task. Therefore, our goal is to explore differentmachine learning techniques to process Big Data EMR, lessening the needed efforts for performing epidemio-logical studies about anaphylaxis. In particular, we aim to study the incidence of anaphylaxis by the automaticclassification of EMR. To do this, we employ the most widely used and efficient classifiers in text classificationand compare different document representations, which range from well-known methods such as Bag Of Words(BoW) to more recent ones based on word embedding models, such as a simple average of word embeddings or abag of centroids of word embeddings. Because the identification of anaphylaxis cases in EMR is a class-im-balanced problem (less than 1% describe anaphylaxis cases), we employ a novel undersampling technique basedon clustering to balance our dataset. In addition to classical machine learning algorithms, we also use aConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify our dataset. In general, experiments show that the most clas-sifiers and representations are effective (F1 above 90%). Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Multilayer Perceptronand Random Forest achieve an F1 around 95%, however linear methods have considerably lower training times.CNN provides slightly better performance (F1 =95.6%).

## Dataset 

consists of computerized records of patients attended atthe Emergency Department of the Hospital Universitario FundaciónAlcorcón (HUFA) (a major general hospital in Alcorcón, a city in theMadrid metropolitan area of Spain, with a population of 167,354) andalso from the diagnosis database of its Allergy Unit, where all cases ofanaphylaxis and other allergic reactions are stored. The records are written in Spanish.
